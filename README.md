# crash_course_in_python
A collection of codes I wrote while learning the Python language. 

I am currently working my way through "Python Crash Course - A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming".

First couple of codes will be short assignments I completed to show understanding of the material covered in a chapter.
